The capstone project serves as an opportunity for students to explore the application of deep learning techniques to interesting topics, such as Computer Vision, NLP, Biology, and Robotics Control. Students may choose to work individually or in groups.\nThe project for this course will require students to write a substantial amount of code to implement a deep learning model. The official programming language and package for this class are Python and PyTorch. Students are free to choose to work with another language or package, but no support will be provided for that.\nIn the context of the course, students have the option to utilize their own data for their project, or they may choose from any publicly available dataset."

However, any material obtained from external sources must be properly cited. It is expected that all submitted solutions are individually written and reflect the student’s own comprehension of the subject matter at the time of writing. Additionally, Python scripts and plots are considered part of the individual write-up and should be completed independently, allowing for the sharing of ideas but not code.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity and Plagerism\nThe comprehension and prevention of plagiarism are of paramount importance. Plagiarism, defined as the unauthorized use of another individual’s ideas, processes, results, or language without proper acknowledgment, represents a fundamental violation of academic integrity.1\nBy submitting any form of work, whether in print or electronically, individuals are required to adhere to the regulations on plagiarism established by MIPT. Furthermore, by submitting the work, individuals grant MIPT the authority to take measures to verify the authenticity of the submitted material, which may include, but is not limited to, employing a plagiarism detection service and sharing the work with other faculty members.2"

The project’s comprehensive nature involves the application of deep learning techniques to diverse domains like computer vision, NLP, speech recognition, or music generation. By challenging students to think critically and creatively, the project encourages the development of innovative solutions for complex problems. Functioning as a vital assessment method, the capstone project enables students to exhibit their problem-solving and troubleshooting skills, affirming their readiness to apply deep learning in real-world scenarios. Students have the flexibility to suggest project topics, and depending on class size, collaborative teamwork may be encouraged to better prepare them for the job market. The capstone project, therefore, not only assesses academic knowledge but also emphasizes practical application and the ability to address challenges in a professional context."
